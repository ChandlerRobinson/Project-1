# The CoolShirts Store!

## Description: 
This project was made in an effort to showcase our hardwork and determination to grow as developers. We built this project to add to our portfolios as we progress our skills from the bootcamp. The purpose of the CoolShirts Store is to provide T-shirt products that were made from sustainable materials and allows the user to easily purchase the shirts to support the local community.

## Technologies utilized:
* HTML - Structures our webpage to include a navigation bar in the header, the main content in which shirts can be purchased, an informative textbox, and a footer featuring "coming soon" products.
* CSS - We used pseudoclasses such as "hover" to add a glowing effect. Many different properties were used including box-shadow and border-style.
* JavaScript - Interactivity was accomplished by executing functions in response to the user's inputs. We used the getElementById method to target certain elements, connecting our files together. With our added features, the user is able to view a size chart, pick a different shirt color, and leave reviews. The size selected will be saved into your local storage for future purchases.
